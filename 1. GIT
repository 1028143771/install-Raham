INTRO, STAGES, HISTORY COMMANDS

GIT: GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER
WHY: To store and track the code.

git = vcs, scm 

v-1: phots --- > 100 lines
v-2: msg   --- > 100 + 50 lines = 150
v-3: reels --- > 150 + 50 lines = 200

vcs = it will store and track each version code separately.
why to store the code: rollback 
rollback: means going back to the previous version.


DVCS: Distributed version control system
we can store code on multiple repos.
ex: Git

CVCS: Centralized version control system
we can store code on single repos.
ex: Svn

STAGES OF GIT:
Working directory: we write our code here.
staging area: we track our code here.
repo: we store our tracked code here. (.git)


note: without tracking we cant store the code on repo.
